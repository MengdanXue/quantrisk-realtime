"""Guard against silently serving fabricated numbers anywhere in the system.

Several code paths - quant agents, the decision API, the report generator, and a
few routers that never got a real implementation - used to answer with invented
numbers when a real data source was missing. That is the worst failure mode a
trading system can have: the endpoint still answers 200 with a correctly shaped
payload, so nothing downstream can tell the numbers were made up.

This module is the single place that decides whether synthetic data may be
served, so the rule cannot drift between call sites:

* Default (``ALLOW_MOCK_AGENT_DATA`` unset or false) - any attempt to serve
  synthetic numbers raises :class:`MockDataDisabledError`, which callers turn
  into a failed task or an HTTP error.
* Explicitly enabled - synthetic results are still produced for local
  development and tests, but every payload carries ``data_source: "mock"`` so a
  caller can reject it.

``src.agents.quant.mock_guard`` re-exports these names; it was the original home
of the guard, before the same defect was found outside the agents package.
